<h3>Illuminate</h3>

<p>Like the universe, our capacity for discovery is limitless. 
And like stars in the sky, the ideas we produce are just a spark 
&endash; flickers of brilliance that weave together to create 
constellations of light. This is what inspires us at TEDxUofW. 
At this year's conference, we hope to explore the plexus of ideas, 
revelations, and observations that reveal through our collective 
pursuit of critical thought and creative inquiry. We invite you to 
join us in discovering the possibilities hidden in our past, present, 
and future that can take the ordinary rhythm of our world and 
illuminate what makes it extraordinary.</p>
