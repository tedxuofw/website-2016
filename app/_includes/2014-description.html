<h3>Transcend with TED</h3>

<p>Transcend (v): be or go beyond the range or limits of.</p>

<p>Our theme this year is Transcend with TED. We're centering it 
around the idea of how TED talks can drive change in all facets 
of your life. Particularly, taking the way you think, feel, and 
act to the next level. How can TED talks inspire change in your 
perspective, emotions, and actions? How can you take what you've 
learned and apply it to your everyday life?</p>
