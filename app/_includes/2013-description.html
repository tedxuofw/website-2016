<h3>The Elements of Transition</h3>

<p><strong>Discover Me: My Unique Piece of the Puzzle</strong></p>

<p>The individual is the sole determiner of the person they wish 
to be. This segment focuses on transformation, development, and 
the creation of that person. We will capitalize on individual 
strengths, weaknesses, experiences, and unique personalities that 
shape our identity and who we become.</p>

<p><strong>"How Do I Fit?": Finding My Puzzle Set</strong></p>

<p>When we begin to develop who we are, we find that there are 
individuals, organizations, and communities who encourage and help 
inspire that development. This segment highlights how an individual 
finds their perfect fit and creates positive change and movements 
in the area that they grow in.</p>

<p><strong>"Coming Full Circle": Creating the Puzzle Image</strong></p>

<p>After learning about who we are and the organizations we fit into, 
we have to consider how this development creates global positivity. 
Our end goal is to look at how we and our organizations can create a 
beautiful picture that makes difference and constructive impacts in 
our world.</p>
