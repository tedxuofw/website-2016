                    <p><strong>Thank you for attending TEDxUofW 2016!</strong></p>

                    <p>Our theme this year was "In Motion", where we hoped to
                    showcase the ever-changing nature of human activity in the Seattle
                    community. To be in motion means to constantly evolve,
                    and what we, TEDxUofW, strive to show is our devotion to
                    the progress that is so evident within our local and global
                    sphere in a University setting.</p>
