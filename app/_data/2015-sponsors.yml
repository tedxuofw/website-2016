    There's healthy. There's tasty. Then there’s healthy and tasty. At KIND, we believe you deserve both—we call it our brAND philosophy. That’s why you’ll find all of our snacks are pretty much the nirvana of healthful tastiness. What began with just 8 bar varieties in 2004 has grown to over 22 bars and 6 Healthy Grains snackable clusters, and a multitude of new recipes being perfected and refined to our standards in the KIND kitchen.
    
    So whether your snacking style is choosy or adventurous (or a little bit of both), here’s something to celebrate: we'll always be thinking up new ways to delight your taste buds and keep your body happy.

    Ubi's software works with the Kinect sensor to turn any surface into a touch screen. Interact with any Windows application using your hand, in-air gestures, or the Ubi pen.
            
    Ubi was originally founded and incubated at the Technical University of Munich and the Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich, Germany. We found a new home in Seattle when we were selected by Microsoft as one of the eleven promising companies, who were chosen from all over the world to be part of its first accelerator program. During this program we developed and perfected our technology making use of the close technical and business guidance from Microsoft.
    
    Our unique technology has caught the world attention and has been featured in CNN, Wall Street Journal, Wired Magazine etc. Microsoft called us as the future of digital displays and featured us in the World Partner Conference 2012. Ubi Interactive is currently one of the many companies in SURF Incubator, located in Seattle, WA.
