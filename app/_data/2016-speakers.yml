      Derek Sutherland is a graduate research associate at the University of Washington (UW), and is also the CEO of CTFusion, a spin-off company dedicated to the development of economical, compact toroidal fusion reactors. Derek, a native of Orlando, Florida, performed his undergraduate work at MIT, and graduated 2012 with a double major in Nuclear Engineering and in Physics, with a strong focus on plasma physics and fusion. Professor Jarboe (PI), Derek, and the rest of the HIT-SI team at the UW issued a press release in 2014 concerning the Dynomak, a full-scale reactor concept that is estimated to cost less than a coal-fired power plant at the same power output. Derek was recognized as one of Forbes’ 30 under 30 in Energy in 2015 for his work on the dynomak reactor concept. CoMotion at the UW awarded the CTFusion team a $50k Innovation Fund to help the company get off the ground, and Derek was a CoMotion Graduate Innovator Award recipient in 2015 as well. He has had considerable experience working with multiple public and private fusion ventures, from the mainline tokamak devices at MIT and General Atomics to the alternative concepts of spheromaks and field-reversed configurations at the University of Washington, General Fusion Inc., and Los Alamos National Laboratories. Derek seeks to demonstrate the method of fusion CTFusion is pursuing scales to an economical fusion reactor that will be able to compete with, and outperform conventional energy sources.
