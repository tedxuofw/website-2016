      Derek Sutherland is a graduate research associate at the University of Washington (UW), and is also the CEO of CTFusion, a spin-off company dedicated to the development of economical, compact toroidal fusion reactors. Derek, a native of Orlando, Florida, performed his undergraduate work at MIT, and graduated 2012 with a double major in Nuclear Engineering and in Physics, with a strong focus on plasma physics and fusion. Professor Jarboe (PI), Derek, and the rest of the HIT-SI team at the UW issued a press release in 2014 concerning the Dynomak, a full-scale reactor concept that is estimated to cost less than a coal-fired power plant at the same power output. Derek was recognized as one of Forbes' 30 under 30 in Energy in 2015 for his work on the dynomak reactor concept. CoMotion at the UW awarded the CTFusion team a $50k Innovation Fund to help the company get off the ground, and Derek was a CoMotion Graduate Innovator Award recipient in 2015 as well. He has had considerable experience working with multiple public and private fusion ventures, from the mainline tokamak devices at MIT and General Atomics to the alternative concepts of spheromaks and field-reversed configurations at the University of Washington, General Fusion Inc., and Los Alamos National Laboratories. Derek seeks to demonstrate the method of fusion CTFusion is pursuing scales to an economical fusion reactor that will be able to compete with, and outperform conventional energy sources.

      Elizabeth Nance is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Washington, with an adjunct appointment in Radiology. Elizabeth was named as a Forbes 30 under 30 in Science and Medicine in 2015, as one of the &ldquo;most disruptive, game-changing and innovating young personalities in science.&rdquo; Her passion is to find ways to more efficiently connect resources and information across multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. Thus far, Elizabeth's career has been built on the guiding principle that these connections can be accomplished by establishing more effective communication, and asking questions in a less field-specific manner. Elizabeth's research focuses on using nanotechnology platforms to understand the movement of molecules in the brain. She is particularly interested in characterizing how common disease hallmarks, such as inflammation, impaired fluid flow, and cell death, impact our ability to treat brain diseases like autism, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. Her long term goal is to utilize nanotechnology in patients to give real-time information about the brain, and take advantage of those disease hallmarks to improve diagnosis and direct therapy.

It's a journey from start to finish that runs like a 23 minute short film. It's part spoken word poetry, part hip-hop album, part oratory, part science-fiction, and fully political. Additionally, John has been a professional public speaker for the past 8 years. He's traveled all throughout the country speaking on subjects such as social justice, building personal success, and unifying the millennial generation into changing our world. He's guest lectured on many college campuses such as the University of Washington all the way to South Seattle College. His lectures range from understanding the dynamics of privilege and marginalization, creating action oriented social justice, and leadership and empowerment.

      Angela Francine Popplewell is a founder and the Chief Storyteller for 100cameras, a non-profit organization that teaches kids around the world that their stories matter and helps them explore their narratives in the larger context of a global world. By building a model that teaches students how to share their perspectives through photography and then sells their images, kids are empowered to become the change makers and provide much needed educational, lifeline, and medical supplies for themselves and other community members. Popplewell has lived and worked abroad with multiple educational and community development programs located in places such as Romania and India. These experiences along with others redirected her passion early on in her twenties from working towards a broadcast journalism career to instead working with kids, the power of storytelling, and local community development initiatives worldwide. Prior to 100cameras, she was one of charity:water's first interns and was Director of Development at New Life of NYC, an inner-city community center located on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Popplewell currently lives in Brooklyn, NY with her husband, Ty, and their adorable newborn son, Theodore Brooks.
