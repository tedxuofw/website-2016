        TEDxUofW represents what I appreciate most: innovation, collaboration, and discussion. I love being surrounded by people who crave knowledge and learning, and that is exactly what I feel when I'm around the TEDxUofW team. The passion in this team is unreal - to know I am surrounded by people who care just as much (if not more!) about what TEDxUofW means and stands for, and are willing and ready to put as much work in as needed to make the event bigger and better than ever, inspires me in ways I can't explain.

        I think the most important thing I want to accomplish at UW is to know that I didn't pass on the opportunity to build friendships and somehow positively impact another person's life. College is such a unique time in our lives, when else will we be surrounded by so many of our peers and in somewhat of the same stage of life. I obviously think my education is going to be a huge part of my future career, but I can't help but think my career path will work itself out. There's going to be no better time to build meaningful friendships and relationship.

        TED is such a powerful brand. When I think of TED, I think of reflection, learning, community, and change. Who wouldn't want to be a part of this movement of self-discovery and inspiration? I hope TEDxUofW becomes well-known across campus through genuine interest. My first experience with TED was in high school, when my teacher played a TED talk. I was immediately drawn to the rich and lively discussion the speakers presented. The topics were completely relevant to me and I noticed that I started thinking about different world issues in depth.

        Outside of TEDxUofW I have become passionate about biology and medicine. In my classes I'm daily intrigued and captivated by the simple and complex processes that are fundamental to life, and how various changes in something as small as a molecule, can have dramatic effects.

        I am back for my second year as a TEDxUofW volunteer because I love our mission to spread ideas. As a female minority, I want to be a part of a movement that spreads ideas, whether it's about innovative technology, how to be a better leader, or highlighting the effects of bullying. Each individual has the power to do good with their voice, but if you don't want to be the one speaking, being behind the scenes is just as good. Certain parts of my own life have been touched by the TED talks that I've watched, and I hope to create the same experience for others. TEDxUofW is growing bigger each year, and it's amazing to watch and be a part of. I know I will be a supporter even as an alum!

        As a newly admitted Political Science student I want to create a community within the department. I'm hoping to bridge the gap between students and faculty by organizing events and forming a group of students with a similar vision. I'm also looking forward to studying abroad at the University College Dublin in fall. My goal is to work at a non-profit organization that works to help solve human rights abuses.

        "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing " is one of my favorite phrases because it describes the idea of always having something left to be learned. As an organization, TED strives to offer new knowledge to anyone who is open to it and understands its value. I think that TEDx events are an incredible opportunity, especially when they are brought to a university community--a place where new ideas grow and thrive. So when I found out about TEDxUofW, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to get involved. I started by attending the event in 2014 and loved the way that it brought people of different backgrounds and interests together to expand their perspectives. It was an event that I took a lot away from and joining the team this year has been a way for me to give back. It is awesome to work with so many people who are passionate about giving others a great TEDx experience.

        I love to dance. A lot. Whether it's in my room with headphones or with choreography in a professional studio, dance has been a constant in my life since early middle school. As a form of expression, I see dance as an essential part of my character and how I choose to portray myself. Dance is who I am and who I want to be until I die.

        TED is a brand that I hope to personally embody. To me, life is all about personal enrichment, learning new things, and in the end spreading those ideas to others who are interested. We live in a time where it has never been easier to learn new things and be exposed to new concepts and beliefs, and TED provides a great format for finding these new ideas. I hope that through TEDxUofW’s efforts, we can help expose curious minds to ideas that inspire them to do something special.

        To me, listening to TED talks is a truly enlightening experience. Talks like these forced me to reflect on who I am as a person and I think they have a lot of hidden value in regards to steering people to finding their passion and purpose. I volunteered so I could help spread this feeling among the University of Washington community and help my colleagues find their inspiration. I believe TEDxUofW has the potential to really make an impact and I wanted to help make it the best event on campus.

        It is the honesty of TEDxUofW that connects each and every viewer and allows him or her to interpret what they will from each talk, be that a new perspective on life or a new way to think. It is this honesty that makes me want to be part of TEDxUofW. By volunteering for TEDxUofW I want to help continue the tradition of people sharing their ideas of the world, in hopes that they can feel enlightened, if only for a second, by each speaker’s words.

        Since its very first conference, TED has created its own culture. TED talks have woven their way into the corporate, academic, artistic and political worlds, spreading new ideas and perspectives all over the planet. TED provides an outlet for individuals to motivate and be motivated by making innovation and creativity attainable. It's a culture that I, in my heart of hearts, identify with to its core, and have benefitted from both in and out of the classroom. Since watching my first TED Talk in high school, the TED brand has played an immense role in shaping my work ethic, my self-motivation, and the way that I view the world's possibilities.

        I have always enjoyed watching TED videos and saw TEDxUofW as an opportunity to give back to this organization. I wanted to be a part of the TEDxUofW because I want to help share great ideas to the general public. I do believe that a lot of today’s conflicts are caused due to lack of understanding and I think that hearing new perspectives will help give us insight to all becoming more open and accepting. It’s especially important for college students to acknowledge the importance of perspective and open-mindedness. I’m very excited to see how a group of college students can come together and host a conference for hundreds of community members.

        For me, TED is a source of hope. It clarifies and validates dreams. Around the time I was deciding on my major, I stumbled upon a Talk by a book cover designer, Chip Kidd. As he humorously described the many facets of his job, I was mesmerized. He weaved the business aspect of publishing with storytelling in art. After this talk, my personal conflict of choosing design or business wasn’t so black and white. I realized that my major doesn’t define my entire future; creativity and business can coexist. Whenever I get stressed out about what my future will look like, I remember what Kidd said: 'Great art can be great business.' That gets me excited for the future. The TED brand makes me excited for the future.

        Outside of TEDx, I am passionate about social justice issues. In the past few years, I have reflected a lot on the definition of success - what society considers success to be and what my definition is or should be. I've tentatively concluded that I will consider myself successful if I engage myself in activities which I am passionate about and if I am able to make the world a little better than it was when I came into it. It seems simple, but I think a lot of people find it difficult to commit to, since it is so often so much easier to stay comfortable within our respective spheres of privilege. TED talks never fail to provide a source of inspiration and motivation for remaining socially conscious. Currently, I am an administrative intern at ASUW Women's Action Commission, which works to educate the community on issues that affect female-identified individuals. In the future, I hope to either directly work in legal advocacy for underprivileged populations or advance a culture of social responsibility in the corporate world.

        Outside of TEDx, I am passionate about the outdoors and have loved it since my childhood years. My favorite things to do are running, biking, and hiking. What I enjoy most about the outdoors is that I can connect with nature and feel at ease from the bustling life in the city. It brings upon a calming and relaxing feeling that doesn't exist elsewhere. Running on a nearby trail at Cougar Mountain or biking around Lake Washington brings me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. I find happiness when I live an active lifestyle, which in turn leads to a healthy mind.

        My relationship with TED began when my mom showed me the video "Rives on 4am." In this comedic talk, Rives pulls together dozens of events, people and objects that all coincidentally have to do with the magical time of 4am. I loved it because it was so different than normal speeches - it wasn't dramatic or emotional like most, but simply the sharing of something he found interesting. That's what I love most about TED. It doesn't have an end goal other than sharing knowledge, and the only thing that qualifies you to be a speaker is that you have a deep passion for something, anything. I hope that TEDxUofW will help our attendees realize that every passion and spark of interest is worth pursuing, and to go for it because, like most speakers say, you never know where it'll take you. I've learned so many things from TED talks, and I hope to create a community at UW to share our TED experiences.

        I am passionate about exploring the intersections between design and social impact: how can paradisciplinary, critically-informed design transform how we experience the our built environment and help to create alternative, sustainable, human-centered futures? The emerging challenges of the 21st century—of sustainability, inequality, urbanization, big data, etc. have warranted a new generation of research-based creators, innovators, and designers to critically engage the visual, material, spatial, technological, social, and environmental dimensions of design. As a designer, it is my sincerest hope that I may be able to contribute to this effort in any capacity. I want to work with brilliant people to create brilliant things for the world in pursuit of globally-informed innovation.

        Something I'm really passionate about is art. Although I only do photography and paint, I enjoy all mediums of art from comics to cinematography. I think it's really interesting to see the different ways people can express themselves, their thoughts, and their beliefs through different mediums. Everyone interprets the world differently and sometimes it's difficult to explain how you feel or experience things. I think art can be used to communicate and breach emotions that words fail to convey.

I am hoping to be a part of the sports business industry in the future, like becoming a sports agent!

        Growing up in the lifestyle I did really shaped the way I am today. Instead of letting my diverse background and experience empower the way I see myself, I was more conflicted with not being able to identify myself with any culture. Being of filipino decent but growing up in a Japanese-American fusion environment made it hard for me feel like I belonged in the cultures I was surrounded by my whole life and made me feel very lost. Eventually, I realized that my experience growing up in different cultures actually contributed greatly to the person I am today and that I should embrace it rather than reject it. So now, my experiences that once made me feel lost has turn into a source of strength and actually motivates me to seek out more opportunities to learn about more cultures and its people, which will, in turn, teach me a lot about myself.

        The TED brand is unique in the way it brings people from all walks of life to one place for the sake of knowledge. It is amazing how much clarity can take place for millions of people in the time span of 18 minutes or less. TED makes ideas accessible and sparks conversations around the world. I hope TEDxUofW is able to bring that same intimate exploration and experience on the campus-scale. TED embodies a passion for awareness.

        Everyone can relate to TED, due to its diverse topics ranging from how to wash your hands to how to mathematically calculate your love compatibility. Everyone always has the opportunity to learn more, and TED provides that for people. TED allows you to think in ways you've never thought or imagined of. With TEDxUofW, I believe students from all different areas of campus, who would never have crossed paths otherwise, will be able to relate to each other on this platform of collective captivation. I hope and believe that TEDxUofW will unite tudents and make them feel like they are a part of a greater whole.

        All of us are here to receive the coveted piece of paper that attests to our completion of some chosen degree. But I hope to accomplish something more than a series of credits. I think the classes we take are only one part of our education during our time at college. I believe and hope I will utilize the remainder of my college experience to truly discover who I am, what I want to do, how to be a better person, how to help others, how to cook, how to be an adult, how to write a check, the list goes on. Both at UW and beyond I hope to accomplish living meaningfully and purposefully. I think that is the best way to summarize the ongoing and evolving list of dreams and accomplishments that compose my goals and hopes.

        Computer Science as topic is really intriguing for me. In an age so prevalent with technology, computers and programmers are at the root of many innovations and inventions that are eventually made commercially viable. Computers and the advances they have gone through since their conception have changed many aspects of day to day living, like our pace of life, width of communication, and access to knowledge. Many branches of Computer Science such as Artificial Intelligence are also burgeoning fields with lots of potential. Helping in such a field would be a really rewarding experience. So I firmly can say that I hold Computer Science as a passion and hope to find a career in it.

        There is no greater feeling than getting your mind blown from a TED video. I can literally feel my brain stretching and growing when a speaker privileges me with the opportunity to think about something in a completely different way. I joined TEDxUofW because I wanted to be apart of something that encourages people to leave the monotony of everyday thinking and learn something exciting, something that puts a new filter on the way they go about their lives. Through TEDxUofW, I hope to provide the opportunity for inspiration and growth, and of course, blow a few minds in the process.
