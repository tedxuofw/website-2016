                    TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. 
                    Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has 
                    grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual 
                    TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak 
                    for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, 
                    free, at <a href="https://www.ted.com">TED.com</a>. TED speakers have 
                    included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard 
                    Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan 
                    and Daniel Kahneman.

                    The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British 
                    Columbia, along with the TEDActive simulcast event in nearby Whistler. 
                    The annual TEDGlobal conference will be held this October in Rio de 
                    Janeiro, Brazil. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where 
                    new TED Talks are posted daily; the Open Translation Project, which 
                    provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as translations 
                    from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has 
                    established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals 
                    with a wish to change the world get help translating their wishes into 
                    action; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, 
                    self-organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows 
                    program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to 
                    amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

                <h2>About TEDx</h2>

                <div class="text-group">
                    <p>
                    In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, 
                    self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like 
                    experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to 
                    spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, 
                    self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently 
                    organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for 
                    the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. 
                    (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)
